## I am Poor/ I am Rich
This project was an assignment to teach how to create a simple UI using assets, from configuring the application icon, to the landing page as well as other UI Elements

## Magic-8-Ball/ Dicee
This project was a quick dive into linking UI elements to variables in the ViewController file. Additionally it involved the use of buttons to trigger events, which in this project was to randomise and return a different image based on an array of images.

## Xylophone app
This simple app used different views to map to a single function while allowing each click to pass a different parameter into the function. This resulted in different outputs (in the form of sound files played). Learned to utilise the sender parameter which UI button passes get 'customised' parameters as well as AVFoundation library to play sounds. Additionally, this project also taught the use of ! on when you are passing in optional params. The ! Tag indicates that you have checked that the code instance will never parse in an empty object into the function parameter. Lastly, within the function we changed the UIButtons alpha value to change it's opacity and have it return to it's original state after 0.2s with the use of DispatchQueue
