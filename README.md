# UdemySwift
Project folder as I go through the "iOS &amp; Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp" course on Udemy


## I am Poor/ I am Rich
This project was an assignment to teach how to create a simple UI using assets, from configuring the application icon, to the landing page as well as other UI Elements

## Magic-8-Ball/ Dicee
This projet was a quick dive into linking UI elements to variables in the ViewController file. Additionally it involved the use of buttons to trigger events, which in this project was to randomise and return a different image based on an array of images.
